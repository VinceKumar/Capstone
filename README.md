## Introduction
Reddit is 4th most visited site in the US([Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US)). It is an aggregation of online discussion communities. Each content community is known as a subreddit, users can post links to other websites or create texts posts, which can be upvoted/downvoted based on the quality of the content. Then a discussion takes place, based on this post. There are a wide spectrum of subreddits, topics include science, poltics, music, various image types, jokes, news, and gaming.

There are currently over 1 million subreddits to pick from. It can be overwhelming having to deal with a list of that many choices, so I thought it would a great opportunity to make a recommender, since nobody has time to look through a list of a million subreddits to see what they might like.
